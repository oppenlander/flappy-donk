# Flappy Donk

A class based (eventually) Flappy Bird clone and realistic barrel jumping simulator.

Inspired by [Flappy Jam](http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam).

Project based on the excellent Phaser/Coffeescript boilerplate, [gulp-phaser](https://github.com/jondot/gulpjs-phaser) by [Dotan Nahum](http://gplus.to/dotan).
